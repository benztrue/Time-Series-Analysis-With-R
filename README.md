This is the R book created for the course [Advanced Data Analysis 2 (2021S)](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/de/course.html?lv=220050&semester=2021S) and will be updated with new content as the course goes on.

[Advanced Data Analysis 2 (2021S)](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/de/course.html?lv=220050&semester=2021S) is a data analysis seminar focused on the study and application of principles of time series analysis using R.

Part of the course will be spent talking about the specificity of time series data and the main approaches to time series analysis, focusing on some of the techniques to analyze this particular type of data.

Computer applications will focus on R statistical language. A moderate knowledge of R and R programming is useful but not necessary, since the course includes a hands-on training on the functions necessary to conduct the analyses described during the lessons.

The lectures are structured as follows:
*   *Theoretical concepts*: this part of the lectures consists will introduce students to the main theoretical concepts of time series analysis;
*   *R Tutorial*: this part of the lectures consists in a hands-on tutorial on the R functions necessary to perform time series analysis. Every part of a time series analysis project will be taken into account, including data wrangling, visual representation, and statistical analysis;
*   *Individual/Group work*: this part of the lectures consists in individual and group work based on the application of the theoretical and practical knowledge described in the previous part of the lectures.

By the end of this course participants will be able to:

* describe the specificities of time series data and the fundamental concepts of time series analysis;
* interpret common types of analysis of time series;
* visualize and conduct time series analysis with R.
