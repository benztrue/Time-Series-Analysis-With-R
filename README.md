This is the R book created for the course Advanced Data Analysis on time series analysis.

The chapters includes **theoretical concepts** on time series analysis and an **hands-on R tutorial** on the functions necessary to perform time series analysis (including data wrangling, visual representation, and statistical analysis). 

By the end of this course, the participants are expected:

* to know the specificities of time series data and the fundamental concepts of time series analysis;
* to be able to interpret common types of analysis of time series data;
* to be able to visualize and conduct time series analysis with R.
